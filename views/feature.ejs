                    issues and continue to embrace the positive aspects
                    of online activities. It also provides a free and
                    comprehensive solution helps libraries identify gaps
                    in their policies and operations by offering a well
                    structured action plan that links to best practice
                    resources. The library can track progress and access
                    resources using an online system tool by library
                    professionals</p>
